The output of the

.Cm metadata ,
.Cm status
and
.Cm volume
commands can be controlled using a format string.
Variables set by these commands can be included in the format string
by enclosing them in curly braces:
.Ql Brq Brq Va var .
These will then be expanded on output.
.Pp
Each command has access to the following variables:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Va playerName
The name of the current player.
.It Va position
The time position of the current track,
in microseconds.
.It Va status
The status of the current player.
.It Va volume

.Pq 0%
to 1.0
.Pq 100% .
.El

It is recommended to check this list for each player,
as different players may not set the same properties.

for a list of all properties in the MPRIS specification.
The most common properties are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Va album , xesam:album
