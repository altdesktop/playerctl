The output of the

.Cm metadata ,
.Cm status
and
.Cm volume
commands can be controlled using a format string.
Variables set by these commands can be included in the format string
by enclosing them in curly braces,
i.e:
.Brq Brq Va var .
These will then be expanded on output.
.Pp
Each command has access to the following variables:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Va playerName
The name of the current player.
.It Va position
The time position of the current track,
in microseconds.
.It Va status
The status of the current player.
.It Va volume
The player's volume scaled from 0.0
.Pq 0%
to 1.0
.Pq 100% .
.El
.Pp
Each property listed in the
.Cm metadata

.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Va album , xesam:album
The album of the current track.
.It Va artist , xesam:artist
The artist of the current track.
.It Va title , xesam:title
